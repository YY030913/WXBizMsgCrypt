The original WXBizMsgCrypt was updated in 2016 1019
https://work.weixin.qq.com/api/doc#10128


It uses python2.7 and Crypto lib, which is no longer maintained and has some issue while installation


Therefore, when I tried to implement it in 2018, I decide to modify WXBizMsgCrypt to adapt python3.5 and migrate to
cryptography, which has more active community and WechatPy use it



Seems working now, at least 3 example can pass
